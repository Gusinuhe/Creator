# Getting Started as a Developer

This guide explains how to create custom templates for the Innoactive Creator. If you never worked with the Innoactive Creator before, read the [evaluator's](evaluator.md) and [designer's guide](designer.md).

## Initial Setup

1. [Create a new Unity project](#create-a-new-unity-project)
1. [Check prerequisites](#check-prerequisites)
1. [Download the Innoactive Creator](#download-the-innoactive-creator)
1. [Import the Hub Modules](#import-the-hub-modules)

### Create a new Unity project

See [instructions](../miscellaneous/unity-setup.md).

### Check prerequisites

Make sure your setup satisfies the [prerequisites](../miscellaneous/prerequisites.md).

### Download the Innoactive Creator

The `Innoactive Creator` can be found at [Innoactive Hub Developer Portal](http://developers.innoactive.de/components/#training-module).

![Innoactive Creators](../images/training-modules.png "Innoactive Creator section")

> Make sure to download the file called `innoactive-creator...`

### Import the Hub Modules

Once you have a new Unity project and a package with the `Innoactive Creator`, follow these steps:

1. In the Unity's toolbar select: `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package...`.

    ![Import Unity Package](../images/import-unity-package.png "How to import a custom package")

1. In the file explorer, find and select the `Innoactive Creator` package to import.
1. An `Import Unity Package` dialog box will appear. Select `All` and then `Import`.

    ![Import Template Window](../images/inspection-template/template-import-package.png "Import Template Window")

>If after clearing the console you still get an error about the `Api Compatibility level`, see [this](../miscellaneous/unity-setup.md#api-compatibility-level) to fix it.

## Further Information

Developer's documentation is to be done. For now, refer to the [transition guide](../transition-to-v1.0/index.md).
