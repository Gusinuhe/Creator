# Legacy Documentation

This section stores the legacy guides for the Innoactive Creator. We recommend to start from here if you never used our product before: for now, our most up-to-date [transition guide](../transition-to-v1.0/index.md) assumes knowledge of the previous state.

The legacy documentation consists of two guides: for the [training designer](training-designer-v0.9.md) and for the [template developer](template-developer-v0.9.md).
