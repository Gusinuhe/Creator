# Template Developer

The Innoactive Creator is a very powerful and flexible tool, and it needs to be customized to meet your company's needs. The customization is performed by a template developer and is delivered as a template to a training designer in charge of creating the final application. Templates hide the complexity from training designers, who can then focus on the creation of content.
