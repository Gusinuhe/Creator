# Introduction

This guide is intended for developers who have already worked with alpha versions of our product. If you have not worked with the Innoactive Creator before, you can skim through the older [training designer's](../legacy/training-designer-v0.9.md) and [template developer's](../legacy/template-developer-v0.9.md) guide to get the general idea first.

We recommend to read the articles in this section in order: [General Concepts](general-concepts.md) provides an overview of the architectural changes, the [Behaviors](behaviors.md) and [Conditions](conditions.md) are practical guides on how to make the old code compatible with the Innoactive Creator v1.0. The [Managing Training Courses](managing-courses.md) article describes how external code interacts with a training course; the [Editor Customization](editor-customization.md) article explains how to make custom behaviors and conditions available for training designers.
