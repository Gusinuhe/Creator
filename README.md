# Innoactive Creator

The Innoactive Creator helps you to train employees in VR in a safe and cost-effective way. With our tool, you can design training processes inside the Unity Editor with no programming at all. As a developer, you can configure it with custom templates and extend it with separate components.

## Getting Started

Refer to our [Getting Started](http://developers.innoactive.de/documentation/creator/v2.0.0/articles/getting-started/index.html) guide.

As a developer, you might want to [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) our repositories instead of importing Unity packages. Given that you have set up a repository for your project and have launched Git BASH inside the `Assets` folder of it, execute the following commands:

[Creator Core](https://github.com/Innoactive/Creator)
```
git submodule git@github.com:Innoactive/Creator.git Innoactive/Creator
```

[Basic Conditions and Behaviors Component](https://github.com/Innoactive/Basic-Conditions-And-Behaviors)
```
git submodule git@github.com:Innoactive/Basic-Conditions-And-Behaviors.git Innoactive/Basic-Conditions-And-Behaviors-Component
```

[Basic Interaction Component](https://github.com/Innoactive/Basic-Interaction-Component)
```
git submodule git@github.com:Innoactive/Basic-Interaction-Component.git Innoactive/Basic-Interaction 
```

[Unity XR Interaction Component](https://github.com/Innoactive/XR-Interaction-Component)
```
git submodule git@github.com:Innoactive/git@github.com:Innoactive/XR-Interaction-Component.git Innoactive/XR-Interaction-Component
```

[Text-To-Speech Component](git@github.com:Innoactive/TextToSpeech-Component.git)
```
git submodule git@github.com:Innoactive/TextToSpeech-Component.git Innoactive/TextToSpeech-Component
```

[Creator Examples](https://github.com/Innoactive/XR-Creator-Examples)
```
git submodule git@github.com:Innoactive/XR-Creator-Examples.git Innoactive/Examples
```
