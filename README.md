# Innoactive Creator

## How to update from an old version
If you previously used a version 1.2.2 or below (formerly called _Hub-Training-Module_) updating to this new version some things have to be considered.
1. Remove the Hub-SDK in _Assets > Extensions > Hub-SDK_
2. Remove the Hub-Training-Module in _Assets > Extensions > Hub-Training-Module_
3. Import the new Innoactive Creator

If you still want to use the HUB-SDK, import the unitypackage after installing the Innoactive Creator and make sure you disable importing the VRTK scene resources which should be under _VRTK-Interactions > Extensions > VRTK > Assets > VRTK > Examples > ExamplesResources > SceneResources_
